As part of this project, we are trying to answer the following questions:

    - Trend in languages, database, platform, framework used this year compared to what people want to learn next year? (LanguageWorkedWith, LanguageDesireNextYear, DatabaseWorkedWith, DatabaseDesireNextYear, PlatformWorkedWith, PlatformDesireNextYear, FrameworkWorkedWith, FrameworkDesireNextYear)
